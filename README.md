# The Astral Body
This is the git repository for my piece "The Astral Body". Below you will find instructions on how to install and run it.
## Installation Instructions
1. [Install git from here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. [Install SuperCollider from here](https://supercollider.github.io/).
3. [Install Node.js from here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
4. In the terminal run `git clone https://github.com/tellmewyatt/the-subtle-body`.
5. Then, `cd the-subtle-body/js/astral_body`.
6. Finally, run `npm run setup && npm run start <part>`. <part> will be either 0, 1 or 2, depending on the part you will play in the piece. Each time you start the piece, just run `npm run start` from this directory. This should automatically start supercollider and open your browser to the correct page. If it doesn't, go to localhost:3000 in your web browser. This page will also prompt you asking for webcam permission. To quit the piece, go back to the terminal and hit CMD+C.
You can press the Escape key to stop the patches from playing. To test if you have sound, please press "d" in the browser window. You should see the score page change. With your body and hands in view of the camera, wave your hands around. You should hear output through the device you have selected. If you need to change the device, stop the program using CMD+C and select your device on your mac. Then restart the program.
